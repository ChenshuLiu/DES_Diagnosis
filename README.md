# DES_Diagnosis
Welcome to the Github repository for the software complementary to the mechanochromic material used for diagnosing dry eye syndrome (DES)! The mechanochromic SCL lens offers an **less invasive** measuring alternative to traditional methods that involves setting non-conformable foreign measuring apparatus between the eyeball and the eyelid. The customized software creates an interface to allow users to dynamically analyze the eye pressure captured by the mechanochromic lens, offering both the option to upload videos or using built-in webcam to capture the change in color in real-time.

This repository is meant as supporting material for the publication (publication link here).
